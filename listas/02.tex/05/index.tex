  Exercise 3.12.[2] A bag contains one counter, known to be either white or
  black. A white counter is put in, the bag is shaken, and a counter
  is drawn out, which proves to be white. What is now the chance of
  drawing a white counter? [Notice that the state of the bag, after the
  operations, is exactly identical to its state before.]
